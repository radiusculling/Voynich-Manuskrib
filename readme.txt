Voynich Manuskrib is a skribblio auto solver and auto guesser.
You can either use automatic guessing to flood guess (as long as there is less than 40 matches) until you get it to be correct
or you can use manual guessing, which you can type out yourself after it sends a msgbox of a list.

Possible words automatically updates as it unscrambles. Ignore it's default list.
